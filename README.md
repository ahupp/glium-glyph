## glium-brush

[Glium](https://github.com/glium/glium) frontend for the [glyph-brush](https://github.com/alexheretic/glyph-brush) text renderer.

It bases on the gfx-brush crate. While it "works" right now, it's quite WIP atm as some parts of the API are only drafted.

Also note that due to an [order bug](https://github.com/glium/glium/issues/1713) in glium, I have lost interest in continuing to work on this crate. If it is useful to you, please approach me by e.g. filing an issue.

TODO:

* add builder struct like the glyph-brush crate has
* complete code style changes
* examples and docs are sitll about the gfx-brush crate
